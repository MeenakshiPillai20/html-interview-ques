    <h1>Interview Questions</h1>
    <h2> 1. Difference between div and span? </h2>
    <p> 
        Div and span both are generic elements which means that neither element convey meaning about the content 
        it contains or its purpose.
    </p>

    <p>Div is a block-level element, which means that it creates a new line and takes up the full width of 
        its container. It is typically used to group larger sections of content, such as paragraphs, headings, 
        or other block-level elements.</p>

    <p>Span, on the other hand, is an inline-level element, which means that it doesn't create a new line 
        and only takes up as much space as its content requires. It is typically used to group smaller sections 
        of content, such as text, images, or other inline-level elements.</p>

    <p>Another difference is that div elements can be styled using CSS to create layout and structure, while 
        span elements are mostly used for styling individual pieces of text or content within a div or other 
        block-level element.</p>

    <h2> 2. Difference between class and IDs? </h2>
    <p>
        Class and ID selector in CSS both are used to identify various HTML element and style them accordingly.
        Classes is atribute of element which is used to identify more than one HTML element. Whereas an ID is a 
        attribute of element which is basically used to identify one single element in our HTML. IDs are only used 
        when one element of the page should have a particular style applied to it. To call class attribute in 
        CSS we use dot operator(.). Whereas to call ID attribute in CSS we use hash operator(#).
    </p>

    <h2> 3. What are self closing tags? </h2>
    <p>
        A self closing tag in HTML are the type of HTML tag that need not to be closed manually by its closing 
        tag which means there is no separate closing tag because it doesn't have any content within it.They are 
        also called empty tags. Some examples of self closing tags are hr tag, br tag, image tag, etc.
    </p>
    <h2> 4. How many types of headings are there? How to decide which to use where? </h2>
    <p>
        There are 6 heading tags in HTML they are h1, h2, h2, h4, h5 and h6 we decide where to use these headings 
        according to the web page we design. Heading should be always meaningful and descriptive.
    </p>

    <p>The h1 element represents the highest level of heading, and the h6 element represents the lowest level of 
        heading. The choice of which heading level to use depends on the content and structure of your page. </p>

    <p>Use h1 for the main heading of your page, Use h2 to indicate major sections of your content, Use h2 for 
        subsections within a h2 section, and continue to use lower levels of headings to indicate further nested 
        content.</p>

    <p>Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g. don't use h2 directly after h1 without using h2), as this can confuse 
        screen readers and other assistive technologies.
        Don't use headings just for styling purposes. Headings should accurately represent the content and 
        structure of your page.</p>

    <h2> 5. Difference between block and inline? </h2>
   
    <p> <b>Block</b> elements take up the entire width of their parent container, This means that any elements following 
        a block element will appear on a new line, even if there is still space available on the current line. 
        whereas <b>Inline</b> elements only take up the space that they need, This means that any elements following an 
        inline element will continue to appear on the same line, as long as there is enough space available.</p>

    <p><b>Block</b> elements create a new line after them and are typically used for larger elements such as headings, 
        paragraphs, and divs, whereas <b>Inline</b> elements do not and are typically used for smaller elements such as 
        links, images, and spans..</p>
    
    <p><b>Block</b> elements can contain other block and inline elements, whereas <b>Inline</b> elements can only contain 
        other inline elements (or text nodes).</p>
   
    <p><b>Block</b> elements have their own vertical space (padding and margin), whereas <b>Inline</b> elements share 
        vertical space with other inline elements on the same line.</p>
        
    <h2> 6. Difference between em and strong? </h2>
    <p>
        em tag indicates emphasis and strong indicates stronger emphasis. em tags are use to make some special text 
        italics. That is a text which is very important so we use em tags so it becomes italics. And strong tags 
        are used to make text bold. That is when the text is very important and we have to make it bold we use 
        strong tag.
    </p>
    
    <h2> 7. What are attributes? </h2>


    <p>
        In HTML, attributes provide additional information about an element. They are used to modify the behavior 
        or appearance of an element, or to provide extra data about the element.
    </p>
    <p>Attributes are always included within the start tag of an HTML element and take the form of a name-value pair. 
        The name of the attribute is always followed by an equal sign (=) and a value, which is enclosed in double 
        quotes. </p>

    <p>
        There are some bullion attributes also like checked, disabled,  required this does not contain any value but 
        have a unique task. An example would be in img tag there is sn attribute called src and alt in which the 
        values are given so the image should be shown. HTML attributes specify various additional properties to the 
        existing HTML element.
       
    </p>

    <h2> 8. What is the use of action attribute in form tag? </h2>
    <p>The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. It is used to specify 
        where the form data is to be sent to the server after the submission of the form.There are two type of URL :- 
        absolute URL: It points to another website link. relative URL: It is used to point to a file within a webpage.  </p>

    <h2> 9. What is markup and hypertext?</h2>
    <p>HTML means Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages.  </p>

    <p>Markup means the way you can structure or format content. HTML is called a markup language because it allows 
        users to organise the appearance and presentation of all the content that should go on a web page. It tells the 
        web browser how to display the page's words and images to the user. It also determines the look and structure of 
        text, i.e. the font type, size, and colour, and even helps in distinguishing the HTML elements from the text, which 
        is done with the help of HTML tags.</p>

    <p>HyperText simply means "Text within Text". It refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within 
        a single website or between websites. It allows users to navigate between web pages by clicking on links.</p>

    <h2> 10. What is main reason or main advantage of label tag?</h2>

    <p>The label element is used to associate a text label with a form input field. The label is used to tell users the 
        value that should be entered in the associated input field.</p>

     <p>The label tag is used to provide a label for the input element with the id attribute of "username". The for 
        attribute of the label tag specifies the id of the associated form control. When the user clicks on the label, 
        the focus is shifted to the associated input element, making it easier to interact with the form.</p>

    <p> It lets screen readers know which form control the text applies to, this lets them accurately tell the user what 
        they are expected to enter in a field. Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions 
        (such as checkboxes) </p>
        
   

    <h2> 11. Difference between HTML tags and elements? </h2>
    <p>
        In HTML, a tag is a keyword or code that defines an HTML element, while an element is a unit of content within 
        an HTML document that is marked up by a start tag and an end tag, or a self-closing tag.
    </p>

    <p>For example, consider the following HTML code: <b>	&#60;p&#62; This is a paragraph. &#60;/p&#62;</b> In this 
        example, &#60;p&#62; and &#60;/p&#62; are the start and end tags, respectively, that define the &#60;p&#62; 
        element. The text "This is a paragraph." is the content of the &#60;p&#62; element.
   </p>

   <p>HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of an HTML document, and they can be used to create 
    a wide range of elements, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, and more.</p>

    <p>Elements, on the other hand, are the actual content within an HTML document that is marked up using tags. 
        HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element, such as its size, 
        color, alignment, and more.</p>

    <h2> 12. Explain br tags? </h2>
    <p>

        In HTML, the &#60;br&#62; tag is used to insert a line break or line feed in a document. It is a self-closing 
        tag, which means that it does not require an end tag.
    </p>
    <p>The &#60;br&#62; tag can be useful for creating content that requires line breaks, such as poetry, addresses, 
        or other types of text that require a specific layout or formatting.</p>

    <p>It's worth Noting that while the &#60;br&#62; tag is useful for creating line breaks, it should be used 
        sparingly in HTML documents. It is generally better to use CSS to control the layout and spacing of text 
        in a document, as this provides more control over the appearance and behavior of the content.</p>

    <h2> 13. Explain how many different types of lists we have in html </h2>
    <p>There are 3 types of lists in HTML, namely:- Unordered List, Ordered List and Description List</p>
    <p><b>Unordered List:</b> An Unordered list is used to create a list of related items, in bulleted 
        or unordered format. It starts with the ul tag, followed by the li tag to show list items inside 
        ul tag. Four types-:   </p>

    <div class="inner">
        <p><b>1)  circle:</b> It gives a circle list item marker.</p>
        <p><b>2)  square:</b> It gives square as list item marker.</p>
        <p><b>3)  disc:</b> This is the default filled circular bullet item marker.</p>
        <p><b>4)  none:</b> This is used to unmark list items.</p>
    </div>

    <p><b>Ordered Lists:</b> The Ordered lists have an order which is either numerical or alphabetical. The 
        ol tag is used to create ordered lists in HTML and just like unordered list, we use li tag to define 
        or show lists inside ol tag. There are 5 types:- </p>

        <div class="inner">
            <p><b>1)  type = “1”:</b> List will start from 1.</p>
            <p><b>2)  type = “A”:</b> Here the list will start from A.</p>
            <p><b>3)  type = “a”:</b> Here the list will start from lowercase a.</p>
            <p><b>4)  type = “I”:</b> The list will start from Roman numbers.</p>
            <p><b>5)  type = “i”:</b> TheList will start from lowercase Roman numbers.</p>
        </div>

    <p><b>Description List:</b> A description list is a type of list where each item has a description. It is also 
        known as a definition list. The dl tag is used to create description list, the dt tag defines the item, 
        and the dd tag describes each item in list. The HTML definition list contains following 3 tags:-  </p>

        <div class="inner">
            <p><b>1)  dl</b> It defines the start of the list.</p>
            <p><b>2)  dt:</b> It defines a item.</p>
            <p><b>3)  dd:</b> It defines the description of each item.</p>
        </div>

    <h2> 14. What are semantic tags? </h2>
    <p>
        Semantic tags are basically that tags which communicate a specific meaning of an element that is most of 
        the HTML element like p tag, em tag, h1 to h6 tag, button tag all are a simple example of semantic element 
        that is it have some meaning.
    </p>
    <p>These elements provide a clear structure and context to the content, making it easier for search engines 
        and other devices to understand the meaning of the content and how it relates to other content on the page.</p>
        
    <p> We know we can use table tag for making table we can make form by using form tag.
        But we don't know the meaning of div and span tag they are used to store text but not specific type of text, 
        we can also store any type of data so they are generic elements. But sementic elements have some special 
        meanings and it works according to the meanings.</p>
