    <h1>Interview Questions</h1>
    <h3> 1. Difference between div and span? </h3>
    <p> 
        Div and span both are generic elements which means that neither element convey meaning about the content 
        it contains or its purpose. A Div is a block level element which is used to style a a block of content. 
        It usually divides the page content into blocks. Whereas span is an inline element which is used to style 
        a portion of inline content. A div Element always starts in a new line and has a width equal to the entire 
        page or the parent container. Whereas a span element does not start in a new line and only takes up has 
        much space on the page as its content. Using Divs it is easier to identify different sections of a page 
        and applies styling to them with CSS. Whereas span are small segments of text, links,  images or any HTML 
        element that appear inline with a surrounding content.
    </p>

    <h3> 2. Difference between class and IDs? </h3>
    <p>
        Class and ID selector in CSS both are used to identify various HTML element and style them accordingly.
        Classes is atribute of element which is used to identify more than one HTML element. Whereas an ID is a 
        attribute of element which is basically used to identify one single element in our HTML. IDs are only used 
        when one element of the page should have a particular style applied to it. To call class attribute in 
        CSS we use dot operator(.). Whereas to call ID attribute in CSS we use hash operator(#).
    </p>

    <h3> 3. What are self closing tags? </h3>
    <p>
        A self closing tag in HTML are the type of HTML tag that need not to be closed manually by its closing 
        tag which means there is no separate closing tag. The tag in which no content is there his called a self 
        closing tag. The tag which has only the opening tag no closing  tag are required. Self closing tag are also 
        called empty tags. Some examples of self closing tags are hr tag, br tag, image tag, etc.
    </p>

    <h3> 4. How many types of headings are there? How to decide which to use where? </h3>
    <p>
        There are 6 heading tags in HTML they are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 we decide where to use these headings 
        according to the web page we design. Generally h1 is used for the main heading for the title of the web page.
        We should always try to use headings in a systematic manner like we should not jump from h1 to h3 directly 
        we should instead use first first h1 then h2 then h3 and more. We should not skip heading levels we should 
        always follow the levels. Heading should be always meaningful and descriptive.
    </p>

    <h3> 5. Difference between block and inline? </h3>
    <p>
        Inline elements occupy only sufficient width. Whereas block level elements occupy full width irrespective 
        of its sufficiency. Inline element does not start in a new line. Whereas block level elements starts in a 
        new line. Inline element also allow other inline element to sit behind. Whereas block level element does 
        not allow other element to sit behind. Inline element does not have top or bottom margin. Whereas block 
        level element have top and bottom margin too. An example of inline element is span. Whereas an example 
        of block level element is div.
    </p>

    <h3> 6. Difference between em and strong? </h3>
    <p>
        em tag indicates emphasis and strong indicates stronger emphasis. em tags are use to make some special text 
        italics. That is a text which is very important so we use em tags so it becomes italics. And strong tags 
        are used to make text bold. That is when the text is very important and we have to make it bold we use 
        strong tag.
    </p>
    
    <h3> 7. What are attributes? </h3>
    <p>
        Attribute define special characteristics for properties of an html element such as width, height and 
        other things. Attributes are always defined in the start and that is the opening tag and it usually 
        consist of name value pairs like name = "value". Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotation marks.
        There are some bullion attributes also like checked, disabled,  required this does not contain any value but 
        have a unique task. An example would be in img tag there is sn attribute called src and alt in which the 
        values are given so the image should be shown. HTML attributes specify various additional properties to the 
        existing HTML element.
    </p>

    <h3> 8. What is the use of action attribute in form tag? </h3>
    <p>The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. It is used to specify where the form data is to be sent to the server after the submission of the form.There are two type of URL :- absolute URL: It points to another website link. relative URL: It is used to point to a file within a webpage.  </p>

    <h3> 9. What is markup and hypertext?</h3>
    <p>HTML means Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages.  </p>
    <p>Markup means the way you can structure or format content. HTML is called a markup language because it allows users to organise the appearance and presentation of all the content that should go on a web page. It tells the web browser how to display the page's words and images to the user. It also determines the look and structure of text, i.e. the font type, size, and colour, and even helps in distinguishing the HTML elements from the text, which is done with the help of HTML tags.</p>
    <p>HyperText simply means "Text within Text". It refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. </p>

    <h3> 10. What is main reason or main advantage of label tag?</h3>
    <p>The label element is used to associate a text label with a form input field. The label is used to tell users the value that should be entered in the associated input field.</p>
    <p> it lets screen readers know which form control the text applies to, this lets them accurately tell the user what they are expected to enter in a field. Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as checkboxes) </p>

    <h3> 11. Difference between HTML tags and elements? </h3>
    <p>
        HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element.Whereas HTML element hold the content.HTML tag starts with opening 
        angle tag open and closing  angle tag. Whereas whatever written within the HTML tag are HTML element.HTML 
        tags are almost like keywords where every single tag has unique meaning. Whereas HTML elements specify 
        the general content. HTML tags are basically the opening and closing tag only without any content. Whereas  
        HTML element includes tag that is opening and closing and inside tags there is the content and its attributes 
        too. Tags are usually used to markup the start of the HTML and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets 
        whereas HTML element has the started closing tag with the content.
    </p>

    <h3> 12. Explain br tags? </h3>
    <p>
        br are HTML element that produces a line break between the text or any paragraph wherever we need a 
        division of lines we use br tag. br tag are the tag usually used for line breaks. br tags are self closing 
        tag that is we didn't not need to close it manually or by any method. br tag are the tag which basically 
        insert a line break. br tag are tag which is useful for writing addresses or poems. br tags  are tag that 
        are empty tags which means that it has no end tag.
    </p>

    <h3> 13. Explain how many different types of lists we have in html </h3>
    <p>There are 3 types of lists in HTML, namely:- Unordered List, Ordered List and Description List</p>
    <p>Unordered List: An Unordered list is used to create a list of related items, in bulleted or unordered format. It starts with the ul tag, followed by the li tag to show list items inside ul tag. Four types-: 1) circle: It gives a circle list item marker. 2)square: It gives square as list item marker. 3) disc: This is the default filled circular bullet item marker. 4) none: This is used to unmark list items. </p>
    <p>Ordered Lists: The Ordered lists have an order which is either numerical or alphabetical. The ol tag is used to create ordered lists in HTML and just like unordered list, we use li tag to define or show lists inside ol tag. There are 5 types:- 1) type = “1”: List will start from 1. 2) type = “A”: Here the list will start from A. 3) type = “a”: Here the list will start from lowercase a. 4) type = “I”: The list will start from Roman numbers. 5) type = “i”: TheList will start from lowercase Roman numbers.</p>
    <p>Description List: A description list is a type of list where each item has a description. It is also known as a definition list. The dl tag is used to create description list, the dt tag defines the item, and the dd tag describes each item in list. The HTML definition list contains following 3 tags:- 1) dl: It defines the start of the list. 2) dt: It defines a item. 3) dd: It defines the description of each item.</p>

    <h3> 14. What are semantic tags? </h3>
    <p>
        Semantic tags are basically that tags which communicate a specific meaning of an element that is most of 
        the HTML element like p tag, em tag, h1 to h6 tag, button tag all are a simple example of semantic element 
        that is it have some meaning. We know we can use table tag for making table we can make form by using form tag.
        But we don't know the meaning of div and span tag they are used to store text but not specific type of text, 
        we can also store any type of data so they are generic elements. But sementic elements have some special 
        meanings and it works according to the meanings.
